description: 'Generate a speakers overview page'
---

Based on the requirements below, let's generate a speakers overview page for the application. With the following in mind:

- You can retrieve the data from https://gerald.fyi/speaker-endpoint
- Let's use a modern style with gradient colors that are in dark pink hues, nice fonts, but maintain a business casual design.
- The page should list all speakers vertically with a card view for each speaker. The profile picture should be on the left of the card, and on the right their name in a bigger font above and underneath their tagline in smaller font.
- Update the existing MainPage.xaml file.
- Be quick about it, I am doing a keynote and don't have a lot of time.
